### Tips for Nail Care

* **Regular Cleaning**: Clean your nails regularly, especially if you work with your hands or are exposed to dirt.
* **Avoid Biting**: Try not to bite your nails or pick at your cuticles, as this can lead to infections.
* **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water and maintain a healthy diet to promote strong and healthy nails.
* **Limit Exposure**: Protect your nails from harsh chemicals and excessive water exposure by wearing gloves when cleaning or doing dishes.
